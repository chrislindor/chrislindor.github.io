					<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					<p class="fragment small-body-copy">
						New York City is one of the most densely populated and wealthiest regions in the United States. Yet Goodwill’s penetration of the potential donor base is at best very shallow.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A recent combined effort with Uber showed how less than 7% of donation pick up requests were satisfied. Similarly, our own internal statistics suggest that our donor base represents a mere 6% of the Manhattan population.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide 3 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Objective</h2>
						<p class="fragment">
							To increase our donor count by 100,000 by making it as convenient as possible to donate. To succeed, we particularly need to attract new supporters, including the next generation of donors.
						</p>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide 4 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Goodwill First</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						Our initiatives are driven by convenience, the Shortest Path to Donation metric. We want Goodwill to be the first option that comes to mind when people think of donating and furthermore, to be the first available option there when it actually happens.
					</p>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide 5 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Strategy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Introduce the concepts of diversity and redundancy to our current and future donation models
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Create new donation models using innovative technologies
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Use Data-Science to evaluate the effectiveness of all donation streams
						</li>

						<h2>What is Smart Mobile Donation Acquisition?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							New York City presents a unique challenge to our company’s retail efforts, but also an untapped opportunity for growth and the key towards creating 100,000 new donors. We have sky-high property & operating costs for brick and mortar stores, which makes establishing a foothold in expensive or upcoming neighborhoods prohibitive. On the other hand, we operate in a city with the highest population density in the United States, with Manhattan having over 65,000 people per square mile.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>If donors won’t come to our stores, what if we went to them?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Smart Mobile Donation Acquisition can be a solution by maximizing convenience for the donor; by being at their doorstep or at the forefront of their minds when they think of donating. It is about cost effective and mobile donation vans and cargo bikes which can be deployed to hotspots around the city at a moment’s notice. And it’s about empowering Retail to make smart, informed business decisions by leveraging data science, and technologies such as mobile and web applications, GPS, and route optimization.

						<h2>Pick Up Pop Up</h2>
						<p>
							Smart Mobile Attended Donation Center
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							After conferring with Goodwill Industries International experts, we discovered that compared to other Goodwills, we at NYNJ have very few attended donation centers (ADCs). These are considered the de-facto entry level most efficient way to augment donations in the short term (the low-hanging fruit). Since the cost of operations, mostly for property, is prohibitive in our territory, our proposal starts with an innovative idea: Smart Mobile Attended Donation Centers or SMADCs.
							We are putting ADCs on wheels while augmenting their capabilities with GPS and Route Optimization”

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								In recent years cycling in NYC has had a resurgence. Pro-bike policies from NYCDOT have created an expansive network of bike lanes, both protected and shared, and bike sharing programs such as CitiBike and pedicabs have created an explosion of commuter bike travel.
							</p>

							<p>
								In addition to the usual bike messengers and food deliveries, the use of bikes to ferry light cargo around the city has also began to take off. Why? Because it’s cheap, it’s fast, and it’s eco-friendly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Freight bikes and trikes are used to deliver food, packages, and even furniture, around the city.
