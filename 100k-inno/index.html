					<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					<p class="fragment small-body-copy">
						New York City is one of the most densely populated and wealthiest regions in the United States. Yet Goodwill’s penetration of the potential donor base is at best very shallow.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						A recent combined effort with Uber showed how less than 7% of donation pick up requests were satisfied. Similarly, our own internal statistics suggest that our donor base represents a mere 6% of the Manhattan population.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide 3 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Objective</h2>
						<p>
							To increase our donor count by 100,000 by making it as convenient as possible to donate. To succeed, we particularly need to attract new supporters, including the next generation of donors.
						</p>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide 4 -->
				<section>
					<h2>Goodwill First</h2>
					<p>
						Our initiatives are driven by convenience, the Shortest Path to Donation. We want Goodwill to be the first option that comes to mind when people think of donating and furthermore, to be the first available option there when it actually happens.
					</p>

				<!-- Slide 5 -->

					<h2>Strategy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Introduce the concepts of diversity and redundancy to our current and future donation models
						</li>
						<li>
							Create new donation models using innovative technologies
						</li>
						<li>
							Use Data-Science to evaluate the effectiveness of all donation streams

						<h2>What is Smart Mobile Donation Acquisition?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							New York City presents a unique challenge to our company’s retail efforts, but also an untapped opportunity for growth and the key towards creating 100,000 new donors. We have sky-high property & operating costs for brick and mortar stores, which makes establishing a foothold in expensive or upcoming neighborhoods prohibitive. On the other hand, we operate in a city with the highest population density in the United States, with Manhattan having over 65,000 people per square mile.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>If donors won’t come to our stores, what if we went to them?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Smart Mobile Donation Acquisition can be a solution by maximizing convenience for the donor; by being at their doorstep or at the forefront of their minds when they think of donating. It is about cost effective and mobile donation vans and cargo bikes which can be deployed to hotspots around the city at a moment’s notice. And it’s about empowering Retail to make smart, informed business decisions by leveraging data science, and technologies such as mobile and web applications, GPS, and route optimization.

						<h2>Pick Up Pop Up</h2>

							Smart Mobile Attended Donation Center

						<img src="./images/smadc.svg" alt="" class="intro-logo" />
						<aside class="notes">
							After conferring with Goodwill Industries International experts, we discovered that compared to other Goodwills, we at NYNJ have very few attended donation centers (ADCs). These are considered the de-facto entry level most efficient way to augment donations in the short term (the low-hanging fruit). Since the cost of operations, mostly for property, is prohibitive in our territory, our proposal starts with an innovative idea: Smart Mobile Attended Donation Centers or SMADCs.
							We are putting ADCs on wheels while augmenting their capabilities with GPS and Route Optimization”

								In recent years cycling in NYC has had a resurgence. Pro-bike policies from NYCDOT have created an expansive network of bike lanes, both protected and shared, and bike sharing programs such as CitiBike and pedicabs have encouraged an explosion of commuter bike travel, in addition to the usual bike messengers and food deliveries.
							</p>

							<p>
								The use of bikes to ferry light cargo around the city has also began to take off, following from examples found in cities like Portland. Moving urban freight by bike/trike is low cost, it’s efficient given the density of the city, and it’s eco-friendly. They’re used to deliver people, food, clothing, packages, and even small furniture. The photo here shows an example of a Manhattan dry cleaning company that uses cargo trikes for pickup and delivery.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of our Smart Mobile plan is to introduce cargo trikes - to act as mobile donation collection points operating in a hub and spoke model. Bikes would be deployed from a “hub” SMADC, or other location, into the surrounding residential or office area to provide doorstep or curbside collection of textile donations. When full, the bike returns to the SMADC to offload, and resume collections.
							</p>
							<p>
								The trikes also offer an unprecedented brand visibility bonus, which we’ll cover in more detail later in the presentation.

						<h2>Where’s Goodwill?</h2>
						<p>
							GPS & Route Optimization
						</p>
						<img src="./images/gps.svg" alt=""  class="intro-logo"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Route optimization is the effective management of the real-time logistics of deploying vans and bikes across the city; saving time, gas, and pedal power. It allows us to plot efficient routes and schedules for vehicles and bikes, and also intelligently adapts to changes to those schedules. Schedule details are synchronized in real-time between the dispatcher and fleet of drivers / riders.

							Data science is an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured,[1][2] which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, data mining, and predictive analytics,[3] similar to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)” (Wiki)

							It is about identifying our success cases, detect patterns of why they worked, being able to export, adapt and replicate the model in a continuum of data gathering and learning.

						<h2>SMS + Social Media</h2>
						<h2>Website</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Initially, we can capitalize on Social Media and SMS (Text messaging) to convey the location of our SMADCs to potential donors. This practice is commonly used with food trucks around the city, where they tweet out the location of their parking spot. People could also text to an SMS shortcode
							</p>
							<p>
								Our plan is to equip SMADCs and SMBINs with GPS transponders. The location data from these transponders can be displayed on a map available on the GoodwillNY.org website.

						<h2>What is the Donation Partner Network?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Donations and partnerships are a large part of Goodwill’s history. So we have identified a few smart ways to strengthen these historic parts in order to expand our reach in the community and increase donations. The smart donation partner network will address the huge impact of seasonal donations by leveraging our partnerships. The approach will be unique to each partner and depend on the type of establishment they have and how helping Goodwill in this capacity would be worth their while. This will include educating them and re-introducing Goodwill as a social enterprise so they can create a Goodwill Buzz in their own network circles and always think of Goodwill First.
						</aside>

						<h2>Seasonal Awareness</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Regardless of climate conditions (extreme cold/heat, rain/snow storms), the collection of donations must continue throughout the year.

								Suggested Content from  (Proposal Draft): “Short Term: < 1 year Our execution strategy is to design a Pilot to proof our Model, from which we can learn and detect behavioral model that we can replicate and escalate to other regions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our immediate plan is target a defined, population dense, upper income area (e.g., Upper  East Side of Manhattan), high subway ridership and unique donation impact historical data, and use SMADC: Smart Mobile ADC and SMBIN: Smart Mobile Bins to collect donations. We would create partnerships with local businesses (dry cleaners), schools, and local high rise buildings to collect donations.  A smart van (GPS enabled) paired with pop up tents with bins near subway entrances, and cargo bikes would saturate  an area. We will have entry level usage of Route Optimization and Mobile Texting technologies.”
